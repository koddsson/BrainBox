# BrainBox - An application from the [Open Neuroimaging Laboratory](http://openneu.ro/)

BrainBox is a web application that lets you annotate and segment 3D brain 
imaging data in real time, collaboratively. You can try it 
at http://brainbox.pasteur.fr.

BrainBox is a web application to share, visualise and annotate MRI brain
 data collaboratively. BrainBox will provide the means to create a 
 layer of collaborative annotation over all the available MRI data without 
 having to rely on a centralised data repository or the necessity of 
 having to install software.

You can try it at http://brainbox.pasteur.fr. Log in with your github 
account and enter the URL to an MRI file you want to visualise, annotate 
and edit. You can also click one of the examples.
